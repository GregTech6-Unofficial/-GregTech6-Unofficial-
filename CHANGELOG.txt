This is the Changelog for GregTech-6-Unofficial
6.15.10-unofficial: (Not released yet).

6.15.09-unofficial:
[FIXED] MESU not consuming energy properly. (cr. kuzuanpa)

6.15.08-unofficial:
[MERGED] 6.14.09 - 6.14.17 Official
- 6.14.17:
- [FIXED] A bunch of tiny Issues.
- [CHANGED] Mob Farm Room is now compatible with Slimes.
- [ADDED] Red Steel and Blue Steel Spikes. Can deal a little bit more damage than Steel Spikes, while also being able to hurt anything that isn't an Iron Golem.
-
-
- 6.14.16:
- [FIXED] Forestry Backpacks should work with some of my Items now. Please do note that you HAVE TO delete the Backpacks Config of Forestry or you will not benefit from this.
- [FIXED] The Buildcraft Lumberjack should now work on all GT6 Trees, and some of the other Mod Trees it did not work on before either.
- [FIXED] ExtraUtils will no longer fuck up Thaumcraft Aspects so badly, you cant even properly progress in Thaumcraft anymore... (yeah I nuked its Thaumcraft Helper Class with ASM)
- [CHANGED] If you harvest a normal Crucible, while its Temperature is greater than the Melting Point of Lava (1300K), it will blow up as if it was overheating. This is to stop people from last minute "rescueing" their Crucibles in case of an imminent Meltdown.
- [CHANGED] Mass Storages and Item Barrels now accept a greater variety of Storage Blocks for packaging similar to Dusts and Ingots. Examples of such include: Plates, Gems, Crushed Ores and Raw Ores. Obviously I mean the "9 Items = 1 Block" conversions, who would ever get the Idea that Chipped Gems get combined to Legendary Gems or something dumb like that, right? RIGHT??
- [CHANGED] Skeletons now drop Headless Arrows most of the time. They still sometimes drop regular Arrows.
- [CHANGED] Vanilla Bats can now only spawn ontop of Vanilla Smoothstone and nothing else. These annoying noisemakers needed to be shut up. Also they fill up Mob Farms too!
- [CHANGED] Most Vanilla Hostile Mobs and Some Vanilla alike Hostiles, in the Overworld and Overworld alike Dimensions, will require a BLOCK Light Level of ZERO to spawn as opposed to 7 or less. This is to mirror a change I saw in one of the most recent experimental Snapshots, meaning Torches and other Light Sources have a much bigger range now. This does not affect Sky Light Levels.
- [CHANGED] Black Sand is now worth 9 Units and counted as a Block of Magnetite Dust (same for its variants). As a result of this the Centrifuge/MagneticSeparator/Sifter Recipes got changed to no longer output Magnetite, since that would be a loop of diminishing returns now. Black Sand in Rivers will only generate 1 Layer instead of 2 now, so there is a little bit of nerf.
- [ADDED] Mossy GT6 Stones can be bonemealed to spread their Moss to adjacent Cobbles and Bricks. They CAN spread to Vanilla Cobble and Stone Bricks too, even though bonemealing those themselves wont spread.
- [ADDED] When Immersive Engineering is installed, some Foods and Liquids will have additional Potion Effects.
- [ADDED] Prismarine Pylons in the Oceans will now contain Pyrolusite or Garnierite Ore, depending on if it is Light Prismarine or Dark Prismarine.
- [ADDED] Shale (see other Mods like Underground Biomes or PFAA) can now be Centrifuged for Clay, Quartz and Calcite.
- [ADDED] Blazing Goo can be used as Heat Exchanger Fuel.
- [ADDED] Mob Farm Room to the GT6 Dungeon. The Storage Pillar in the Middle of the Room is so nobody should be tempted to actually use this as a normal Storage Room, because that would reduce Mob Spawns due to being too close.
- [ADDED] Bedrock Vein Room to the GT6 Dungeon. It also contains a veriety of Scaffolds and Steel Bars and demostrates their decorative usage.
-
-
- 6.14.15:
- [FIXED] Advanced Crafting Table was caching Recipes too aggressively.
- [FIXED] Instant Health and Instant Damage Potions not properly working in GT6 Drinkable Fluid Containers or "poisoned" Food Items from the Bathing Pot.
- [REMOVED] Legacy Recipes for processing Impure/Pure/Refined Piles of Dust have been removed. You can still throw them into a Cauldron or put them into a Shredder though. Impure Bedrock Dust is unaffected by this.
- [CHANGED] GT6 Blocks that can set the area around them on Fire will consider Vanilla Chests flammable for the sake of spreading Fire, even though they still cant burn up, so they wont break.
- [CHANGED] Many of the Metallic Utility Blocks are much cheaper now, including the Mass Storages. Now most of them require Screws to be made though, giving people incentive to actually make Screws.
- [CHANGED] Treecapitation now works Top Down instead of Bottom Up
- [CHANGED] The Sluice now outputs less Byproducts and more of the Main Product, if the Byproduct List is too short to fill the entire Output.
- [CHANGED] Path Blocks will get a Slab Shape when you go downhill.
- [CHANGED] Large Wooden Tanks now take Lead instead of Iron for their Walls and Valve.
- [CHANGED] Meteoric Iron/Steel has far better Durability now, comparable to Blue Steel and Damascus Steel. This enables both, a way to use the new Big Meteorites, and having the Magnetic ability on more Tools.
- [CHANGED] Crucibles, Anvils, Sifting Tables and Molds/Basins should now handle the copying of certain Textures better.
- [CHANGED] Things outputting Impure Bedrock Dust are now outputting normal Bedrock Dust. Magnetic Separator Recipe got adjusted for that ofcourse. You should get rid of all the Impure Bedrock Dust you still have, since that may be removed in later Updates.
- [CHANGED]
- The Material value of Stone Blocks of most Rock Types, along with Sand, Soulsand and Glass, is now 9 Units instead of 1 Unit.
- Do note that most things made of these Materials will stay at their original Value, since not all Stone is equally affected.
- This also changes the Material Value of ALL small Rocks to be 2.25 Units instead of 0.25 Units, which is an intended Buff.
- Glass Blocks are 9 Units, Glass Panes are 1 Unit now, With Glass Panes being considered "Glass Plates" now.
- The Basin can now handle pouring Stone and Glass Blocks.
- Gravel is now considered the Block of Stone Dust. Existing Stone Dust Blocks in the World will ofcourse stay themselves.
- Sand, Red Sand and Soulsand are now "Block of ..." of their respective Types, with 9 Dusts being one Block.
- [ADDED] By rightclicking an already OPEN Keybased Safe with a Blank Key, you can now copy that Safe's Key ID.
- [ADDED] Niter Veins can now spawn in Deserts near the Surface.
- [ADDED] Gunpowder Sticks, aptly named "Boomsticks", which work like Dynamite Sticks, but only with Fortune III instead of V. And yes Boomstick is usually the name for a Gun.
-
-
- 6.14.14:
- [FIXED] Crucibles crashing when certain Items are inserted.
- [FIXED] Bronze Drums were somehow allowing Acids to be contained... (was a copypaste error)
- [FIXED] Boilers somehow did not explode when they were pressurized while you harvested them with a Wrench.
- [FIXED] Ocean somehow displaced Swampwater even when it was not supposed to.
- [FIXED] Several Issues with the Rotational Pump, it should be smarter now.
- [CHANGED] Centrifuges and Sifters now have better Recipes for processing Tiny Purified Crushed Ores.
- [CHANGED] Grass Paths are now Dirt Paths, just like in most recent Vanilla Minecraft Versions. That means you can now actually place them on Dirt, Mycelium, Podzol and Coarse Dirt.
- [CHANGED] Wrenches and Monkey Wrenches now only cost 4 Units instead of 6 units of Material to make.
- [ADDED] A little bit of NEI info on Mercury Bottles and making Steel in a Crucible.
- [ADDED] Detection of Corrupted Chunks to the Ocean World Generator. This should probably help reduce the amount randomly corrupted Chunks because of Minecraft being stupid. If this turns out to be too obnoxious, I will remove parts of this Feature again.
-
-
- 6.14.13:
- [FIXED] Crash Bug with Washing Stuff in Cauldron on Servers.
- [CHANGED] The Big Layer Ores like Coal and Salt now give an 8th of an EXP instead of half an EXP.
-
-
- 6.14.12:
- [COMPAT] Chisel
- Granite, Andesite and Diorite of other Mods such as Botania, Ganys Surface, Et Futurum and GregTech-6 now work with Chisel, but apparently only one way...
- I removed the damn Cobblestone and Glowstone OreDict equivalencies.
- Glowtus can now be chiseled into different Colors and GT6 Logs can now be chiseled into their All-Bark Variants.
- [COMPAT] The Witchery Spirit World now generates GT6 Stuff properly just like the Overworld.
- [FIXED] Filter Blocks were kinda broken, so that needed a change. This may break your Setups in some cases.
- [FIXED] Bricks and nether Bricks were not placeable on the Floor like Ingots.
- [FIXED] Other Types of Coal could not be made into "Bricks"/"Ingots" before, now they can.
- [FIXED] The Cow Cooldown of Hunger Overhaul is now respected by Wooden Buckets.
- [FIXED] Burning Boxes and Basic Machines can no longer be rotated while they are lit or actively processing something.
- [FIXED] Item Filter Covers no longer go inbetween two Item Pipes, which was causing confusion as to why they are "not working" since you were able to place them in such a way.
- [FIXED] Clientside FPS Lag when holding Rightclick with GT6 Tools is now gone for good.
- [FIXED] The Boxinator somehow did not have Recipes for Nugget->Ingot, Chunk->Ingot or Dust piling. This was a really big oversight.
- [FIXED] Bluepower Volcanos and Immersive Engineering Village Houses no longer let you skip to Tungsten and aluminium anymore.
- [FIXED] Coke "Ingots" were not considered "fuelCoke", "coke" and "coalCoke" for the OreDict, like Coke "Gems" are.
- [FIXED] Burning Boxes were permitting the use of tiniest Piles of Dust to "not generate Ashes", which was a Bug. Now it will require a minimum amount of Material to at least give a 72nd Pile of Ashes (if the Material you use would give Ashes in the first place).
- [CHANGED]
- A bunch of Recipes that previously outputted Iron, now output something else, usually Hematite.
- I try to make people either process Hematite properly or dig up Black Sand. Looting it from places is okay too.
- The Roaster now outputs Hematite instead of pure Iron. And yes, Roasting was too easy for this...
- Centrifuging Red Sand gives Hematite.
- Centrifuging Sluice Juice gives Antimony instead of Iron.
- Centrifuging Lava or Pahoehoe gives Lead instead of Iron now.
- [CHANGED] Ores now give 4 times the Stone Dust when crushed. That should fix Limestone shortages in many cases.
- [CHANGED] The Crusher now has 12 Output Slots instead of 6. Because the Block of Raw Ore can be crushed now, and that means more throughput is needed.
- [CHANGED] GT6 Loot Chests can now be picked up with their Loot inside, as long as you did not open them beforehand! This should spare explorers of Dungeon Loot cluttering their Inventories, until they are home.
- [CHANGED] If there is a Fire Block in front of a Burning Box, it will randomly ignite. This technically makes automation using the Dispenser possible, but still cumbersome and dangerous enough so you want an Igniter.
- [CHANGED] Dispensers now work on my Wooden Buckets too.
- [CHANGED] Eletrotine and Teslatite are now the same Material. I will name them both Nikolite by default, and they will be interchangeable between Blue Power and Project Red.
- [CHANGED] Bumblehives in the wild can now be measured with a Thermometer. This should help finding a proper new Home for a Hive.
- [CHANGED] Axes and such are now able to chop down whole vanilla Mushrooms in one go.
- [CHANGED] Crucible Crossings will take Vertical Redstone Signals and emit a weak Signal Horizontally, making it easier to Redstone Molds and Faucets.
- [CHANGED] Craponite Dust is now the new Main Component of Purple Drink instead of Sugar.
- [CHANGED] Dynamite now has Fortune V instead of Fortune II, making it better than most Hand Tools.
- [CHANGED] Placing Dynamite with the Hand Drill will automatically link it to Remote Activators in your Hotbar.
- [CHANGED] Lignite now has twice the Furnace Burn Value, meaning it is now half as good as Coal. (It was a quarter before, and yes the Fluidized Bed Burning Box takes it into account too)
- [CHANGED] Rotational Pumps no longer distinguish between the 4 different Types of Water, and just consider them the same when scanning the Area. This should make Areas where Rivers and Oceans mix much easier to drain.
- [ADDED] Scraps can now be placed on the Floor like Ingots and Plates. Though they wont stack tall. They just are on the Floor and look all Dusty and such.
- [ADDED] NEI now additionally shows a Version with Black Sand Blocks and Coal whenever an Alloying Recipe for when Magnetite or Carbon is shown.
- [ADDED] GT6 Flowers now work in Flower Pots, I hope. Slightly glitchy for sure.
- [ADDED] Brick Burning Box. Very inefficient and Earlygame.
- [ADDED] GT6 Dungeons now have Ore Blocks and Ore Crates in their Storage Rooms.
- [ADDED] Asbestos now has Jade as a Byproduct, making Fortune III Tools more available.
- [ADDED] The Drain can now produce liquid Slime should a Slime be ontop of it, and Squid Ink when there is a Squid ontop (good luck figuring out how to do that, I know a way). Slime works with Green, Magma, Maze and Pink Slimes.
- [ADDED] GT6 Logs can now be crafted into their All-Bark Variant using some Bark. For Non-GT6 Logs you will still have to use the Soft Hammer after placing the Log though.
- [ADDED] Raw Ore Items similar to the ones in the latest Minecraft Snapshots. They will only be dropped if you use a Fortune Tool to harvest the GT6 Ore Blocks.
-
-
- 6.14.11:
- [NOTE] Erik3003 changed a tiny bit of the Internals of the Moderated Reactors, everything should still work as usual though.
- [COMPAT] Caveworld 2 now generates Stone Layers too. Its Ore Blocks will not be replaced though, so you get its Vanilla-alike Ores inside my Stone Layers. by the way did you know its "Universal Chest" is an Enderchest that goes across Savegames? Neat, isn't it?
- [COMPAT] Better Storage has some things been done to, but not much. I could not assign Material Data to its Chests and Stuff due to them using NBT instead of MetaData...
- [COMPAT] Et Futurum Requiems Copper Blocks and their Variants are now properly supported and not exploitable anymore.
- [FIXED] I messed up Ardite and Aredrite. That should be fixed now.
- [CHANGED] Bookshelves now count Writable Books and Written Books for Levels on the Enchanting Table. Same goes for GT Books and most other things that look enough like Books, some of which even count as Enchanted Books.
- [CHANGED] Bookshelves made of Magical Materials will give an additional Bonus to Enchantment Power. Greatwood and Livingwood would be a good example of ones that you can get for cheap.
- [CHANGED] Burner and Cryo Mixers now have Parallel Processing like the Normal and Electric Mixers.
- [CHANGED] Bedrock Ores can now overlap, so you can get a Bedrock Ore Spot with two or more different Bedrock Ores generating in it. However this is insanely rare, so do not try to go search for it! (I had to x10 the Bedrock Ore Probability in order to find just one of this in Superflat)
- [CHANGED] Bedrock Lava Springs in the Nether got nerfed to 500 times less Output (so still twice as good as Overworld Lava Springs). Only applies to newly generated ones though!
- [CHANGED] Fluid Pipes will now show all Fluids that are currently somewhere within all connected Pipes, when hit with a Magnifying Glass.
- [ADDED] Spray Cans can now be used to dye Sheep, Wolf Collars and Grass (if their Color is applicable). So you no longer need to Silk/Spade Harvest Grass to Bath/Craft it into one of the the 4 dyed Variants, and it is easier to spawnproof your Lawn that way.
- [ADDED]
- Blue Spruce
- Can be found in Mountainous Biomes.
- Its Planks are White, and the Tree is quite tall on average, making it a very good Wood Source.
- It also turns Dirt and Grass to Podzol below, making it far easier to get that Stuff renewably now, similar to how it works in later Versions of Vanilla Minecraft. (remember: Spades are super easy to use for digging Stuff like Podzol)
- When Biomes o'Plenty is installed it will drop Pinecones, that are now registered as Windfall to Forestry, and they also finally got a Biomass Recipe assigned to them that I originally forgot about.
- During certain periods of time it will turn into a Christmas Tree.
-
-
- 6.14.10:
- [COMPAT] Et Futurum Requiem
- Default Config Pack updated for Et Futurum Requiem.
- Deepslate will generate near Bedrock now. It will generate 1 Block higher in Slime Chunks specifically.
- [IMPROVED]
- The Vanilla "getting kicked back to Main Menu, when launching Singleplayer"-Bug should be mostly fixed. (it happened to me a few days after we fixed it sooooo, maybe it is not properly fixed)
- It wasn't my fault, but hey mostly fixed is mostly fixed.
- Please test for yourself if it actually works, since it is random and my dozen Tests have definitely been a fluke. (though it might be less likely!)
- The Fix also has the side effect of loading Singleplayer Worlds without having that initial Lagspike, so getting into the World feels a bit smoother.
- [IMPROVED] Creating Material Dictionaries no longer happens on Startup and is now done on the fly.
- [IMPROVED] When you break Fluid Pipes, they will try to move their content to connected adjacent Blocks/Pipes in order to not waste it. Keyword being TRY, because if there is nowhere to go they will still send it to the Garbage Dump.
- [FIXED] Button Panel was resetting its Chiseled Design whenever a Block Update or similar happened.
- [FIXED] Hoppers and Queue Hoppers will no longer let other things pull from their Output Facing.
- [FIXED] Bedrock Drill will actually output the right Ores and Stones in Atum, Betweenlands and Erebus. IT will also output Deepslate instead of Vanilla Stone in the Overworld if applicable. (ofcourse other Stone Layer Stones will still be outputted)
- [FIXED] Ice Harvesting with the Saw now actually works properly and does no longer spawn Water Blocks.
- [FIXED] A Crash when Furnace Recipes with Liquid XP were added to NEI.
- [FIXED] Dust Funnel is now slightly smarter when pulling and pushing Items.
- [FIXED] Rightclicking a Path Block with a Shovel should no longer prompt other Shovel Placer Features like Torches.
- [FIXED] A bunch of Issues with Crucible Molds/Basins. There was more than one, that this mini rewrite solved.
- [FIXED] Radioactive and Rare Earth Centrifuging requires Refined Ores only now instead of also allowing Purified Ores. The Recipe overwrote the regular Centrifuging of Purified Ores, resulting in Recipe inconsistencies.
- [FIXED] Byproducts for several Gem Ores, along with some other Ores.
- [CHANGED] Texture of the Generifier. It now looks much more like "sucking the specialness out of Items", instead of an Epileptic Rave Machine.
- [ADDED] Small Malachite Ore near the Surface.
- [ADDED] Config to make Gravel never drop Flint when harvested by a Player. (This was added because another Mod does it, but very badly, so I needed to replace that Feature using GT6, ofcourse Flint will still drop by Default)
- [ADDED] Miniature Portal to Aroma1997's Mining Dimension.
-
-
- 6.14.09:
- [NOTE] The Default Config Pack updated to disable Fastcrafts Chunk Culling, so that Ocean Floors are now rendering properly again. Set "enableCullingTweaks" to false in the "config/fastcraft.ini" File, if you experience this Issue.
- [COMPAT] Aroma1997's Mining Dimension is now Compatible with my Worldgen.
- [COMPAT] Et Futurum Requiem is now supported properly and up to date. Its Netherite Items and Ore Blocks are preferred over the ones of Netherite Plus. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/et-futurum-requiem/files
- [FIXED] Biome dependent Stone Layer Ores were not generating at all, due to me forgetting to Lowercase the Biome Names.
- [FIXED] Infinite Worldgen Loop with Oceans, because I forgot to set the Block Update Flag to 2 during Worldgen, because ofcourse I left it to default when I fixed another Ocean related Bug...
- [FIXED] Coal and Oil Shale Stone Layer Ore Blocks were flammable t othe point of burning up way too much. Now they are still flammable but Fire wont spread to them.
- [FIXED] Railcraft Crowbars should now be able to remove Covers again, even if they dont use the overlay for technical reasons.
- [FIXED] Applied Energistics Quartz Cutter in Advanced Crafting Tables.
- [FIXED] Forestry Backpacks didn't work with Autocollecting Tools, because the Magnetic Autocollect did not throw an Item Collect Event.
- [FIXED] Chainsaws used WAY too much durability for Treecapitation!
- [FIXED] Pipes were not able to fill Molds at all due to some stupid Bug.
- [FIXED] Worldgeneration in different Dimensions had the same RNG as on the Overworld. Now the Seed is being XOR-ed with the Dimension ID to prevent that. This has the convenient Side Effect of the Overworld staying the same as before, because it's ID is Zero.
- [CHANGED] Barrels and Drums did not have the same Melting Points that Pipes have. I fixed that. Metal Drums now have 1.25 times more Heat Resistance, while Wooden Barrels and Plastic Cans got a properly assigned fixed Value, which in most cases should not make them burn up.
- [CHANGED] Blue Steel is Red Steel now and vice versa. This should fix my ages old fuckup of the Recipes. Everything should still be the same as before when it comes to Stats, just the Color of the Material changed. If you used Matter Fabricators to make Red/Blue Steel for some reason, you may need to check the USB Stick with the Recipe.
- [CHANGED] Oil and Natural Gas can now pass through Water. In the case of Oil this will result in Buildcraft alike Oil Fountains or puddles in the Ocean, should you be super lucky (since that requires Oil to be vertically exposed to the Ocean). If not, just dig a tunnel down and it happens too. XD
- [ADDED] Railcrafts Firestones now work as Fuel in Solid Burning Boxes and can also light TNT, Burning Boxes, Coke Ovens and the likes. Please be aware that Burning Boxes need the Firestone to he hoppered in to work, since they otherwise work like Flint and Steel. Firestones are not "used up 100%" when in a Burning Box, and will always leave with 1 Durability left. Carving Firestones in the Laser is now doable in lower Tiers too.
- [ADDED] In a potentially failing attempt of fixing the Nichrome Issue in Stainless Steel, I added a Version of the Recipe that takes Nichrome instead of Invar, which is ofcourse in the proper ratios. I do not know how well that will work for people using the Crucible, but better than nothing. I did the same for Ultimet and Signalum too.
- [ADDED] Barbecue Sauce (BBQ Sauce), because why not.
- [ADDED] Axes, Saws and Chainsaws can now place Saplings too. They will still place Workbenches if Saplings cant be placed.
- [ADDED] Tooltip for Covers that can be controlled with the Cover Controller Cover. In case of Covers where the Cover Controller Cover is required (such as Shutter Cover), it will be Cyan instead of Dark Gray to make it easier to see.
- [ADDED] Petrified Wood is now craftable into the old "made of Stone" Vanilla Slabs. The Injector also has a Recipe to turn regular Wood into Petrified Wood now.
- [ADDED] Config to make it possible to disable specific Ores in Stone Layers from generating.


6.15.07-unofficial:
[FIXED] GregTech's Achievement Page not loading.
[FIXED] I accidentally made Chromite's original smelting recipe available and reverted the ore washing recipe of Chromite. Now it should be back.
[CHANGED] Revert the new solar system change temporarily. It will be improved and released later. The old solar panels should remain the original design.


6.15.06-unofficial:
[NOTE] Original Solar Panels are changed into ULV Solar Photovoltaic Panels.
[FIXED] Molten Sodium Bisulfate not obtainable from crucible.
[FIXED] Fuel Cleaner does not produce exploding noise now.
[FIXED] Titanium Niobium Carbide Tanks' local names are wrong.
[FIXED] Cheese having wrong nutrition in TFC.
[CHANGED] Draining Well does not produce mud balls now.
[CHANGED] Red Steel and Blue Steel now have correct alloying recipes and compositions.
[CHANGED] The Amount of Terrasteel in Terra Pick and Axe is changed.
[CHANGED] Some Ores can generate in Nether now. Copper can generate in Vanilla Stone layers only in Mountains Biomes.
[CHANGED]
New Solar System. It is similar to the Steam Boiler System.
The new solar system is a multiblock structure. Now the Solar Photovoltaic Panel works as Solar Panel like before, but it output Light Power (LP).
Then you need Light Power Transformer to transform LP to EU.
And you can use Optical Fiber to transport LP from a lot of Solar Photovoltaic Panels.
Also now there is LP sensor like EU sensor.
[COMPAT]
The Solar system can also work in Twilight Forest or Planet now (Twilight Forest or GalacticCraft should be loaded)
[ADDED]
Aquatic Farm. Multiblock structure. It consumes water/aquatic nutrition water and fish fry and cultivates fish for you.
You need to think about how to deal with the output aquatic waste water.
[MERGED] 6.14.02 - 6.14.08 Official
- 6.14.08:
- [FIXED] Some Issue where the World somehow doesn't load.
- [ADDED] HSS-based Recipes for Railcraft Rails.
-
-
- 6.14.07:
- [BROKEN] You might not be able to actually launch the Game on certain Computers. Nothing corrupting. ^^
- [NOTE] I've been indirectly asked through bear, to make GT6 Tools compatible with "Progressive Automation", but it only accepts Vanilla alike Tools, meaning that will never really work. But my Wrench can harvest all of its Machines now at the very least.
- [COMPAT] Per Fabrica Ad Astra (PFAA)
- If CustomOreGen is not installed, PFAA still works, this means PFAA Blocks exist but they wont generate. Because of this likely intended thing, I will now generate the 25 PFAA Rock Types with my own Stone Layer System alongside the other Stuff, if PFAA is installed without CustomOreGen.
- The PFAA Sands now have more appropriate Processing, and the PFAA Clay Balls now have fitting Material Data.
- I made sure all Ores actually work. Realgar (Red Gem Ore made of Arsenic + Sulfur) did not have any Material Data.
- [IMPROVED] Advanced Crafting Table now consumes Items in a better order. Also fixed a brand new Bug I caused earlier.
- [FIXED] Magnesite and Magnesium Carbonate are now the same Material, like they should have been.
- [FIXED] The Collect Sound for autocollecting Tools is now matching the vanilla Sound in Pitch and Volume.
- [FIXED] Battery Boxes were not able to charge Tools unless a Battery was inside of them to make them able to accept Power. (their internal buffer would eventually reach zero when charging tools only)
- [FIXED] Aqua Regia Processing Ores emitted too much Water, effectively turning Oxygen into Hydrogen.
- [CHANGED] Air Vents now do 256000L per 360 ticks at a time, instead of only 16000. They have an Offset for ticking too now, so you can use multiple Vents on one Pipe/Drum/etc now.
- [CHANGED] There is now more Galena Veins in the World, and visible on the Surface in Mountains.
- [CHANGED] A bunch of Ores, that I deemed way too useless years ago, has been added back. None of them are required for anything, old Worlds are safe as always.
- [ADDED] NEI Handler for putting Toolheads on Handles. I used the Machine Recipe Handler and Fake Recipes for that one.
- [ADDED] Arsenic can now be used to make Poison and Harming Potions.
- [ADDED] Crushed Purified Biotite can now be heated in the Dryer to make Argon Gas from it. It is mostly a Byproduct of other Ores like Asbestos though,
- [ADDED] Gypsum, Trona and Mirabilite now have Recipes to create them by mixing some Chemicals with Water (They can be dried back too). Perlite now has a drying Recipe that turns it into Obsidian aswell.
- [ADDED] Iron and Hydrochloric Acid now have a few more Chemical Reactions. This will improve Hematite extraction from Limonite. Oh and Limonite now smelts into Hematite, like it does in real Life, so it is no longer an easy Shortcut, like it was before.
- [ADDED] Vanadiumsteel Fluid Pipe that can handle Acids and otherwise has the same Stats as Tungstensteel (which cannot handle Acids).
- [ADDED] Porcelain Cup Recipe. Now you dont need to rely on Loot anymore to get those small Cups.
- [ADDED] Two more variants of Black Sand. They are essentially identical in function when it comes to getting Iron, Vanadium and Gold, so it is not much of a change. They also came from PFAA and were dormant and only somewhat compatible until now.
- [ADDED]
- Bentonite Clay, Kaolinite Clay and Palygorskite Clay (try to say that 3 times fast), which are Yellow, White and Blue Clay.
- The only reason I did this, is because I noticed PFAA added those, and they were long dormant in my Ore Materials Section (I did not think of them as Clays back then), so now I gave them Life!
- Please take note that I changed the Electrolyzation Output of Clay, and that Vanilla Clay does no longer give Lithium. Only Brown Clay does.
-
-
- 6.14.06:
- [NOTE] Hindsight is 2020, and I did fuckup my fix for the Water Generation Bug last year, so here we go with the first Release of 2021. XD
- [FIXED] Rivers, Oceans and Swamps generated partially at XZ 0,0 to XZ 15,15 because I forgot an Offset. This also caused the first layer of those Waters to be at the wrong height.
-
-
- 6.14.05:
- [BROKEN] DO NOT USE!
- [FIXED] The Explosion Sound does no longer spam for Machines in the Rain and similar if you turned off those Explosions. Instead it waits a bit before it sends that Sound again.
- [FIXED] Buildcraft Wrench Stuff can now be Sneak Rightclicked with an Electric GT6 Wrench without switching Modes, as long as the target is a TileEntity.
- [FIXED] You know how you can open Pipes to Air Blocks? Well I added that functionality for Liquid and Gas Blocks too, so that is now fixed.
- [CHANGED] All Fluorite Byproducts to use the more colorful Versions of Fluorite.
- [CHANGED] Also changed the Byproducts of Naquadah, Trinium, Duranium, Tritanium and Dilithium containing Ores. Desh has related Byproducts to those three now.
- [ADDED] A few more Recipes for Wooden Stuff like Rings, Item Casings and Stuff.
- [ADDED] One more Icon to the Warning Sign Cover. It's that Checkerboard-ish Circle that is usually on Crashtest Dummies.
- [ADDED] Builders Wand. Pretty much is doing what the ones of other Mods do too. It places Blocks! It can also destroy Thaumcraft Nodes like the Crowbar does. Why? Because it's a neat Easter Egg, and if a Node happens to be in the way while building, you can just go smack it with the Wand.
- [ADDED] Clay Molds for everything that is mentioned in the Molds Book, that way you can actually craft them without having to magically know all the Chiseling Shapes for Molds.
-
-
- 6.14.04:
- [BROKEN] DO NOT USE!
- [NOTE] Released a tiny bit early due to testing GitHub Actions to Release GT6 instead of using a Solution on our own Server.
- [NOTE] The URL leading to the Supporter Lists links to something that runs on a different Subdomain, so that it is easier to distinguish the traffic when using something like Pi-Hole as your DNS and Adblocker, as I happen to do since last Release. This probably doesn't matter to you though. The old Link is ofcourse still usable.
- [IMPROVED] Ores that generate between two Stone Layers are now no longer stopped by other Mods equal Blocks (like comparing GT Marble with Chisel Marble, both should obviously count as Marble, which they did not before)
- [IMPROVED] Basic Machine Input Tanks now have Capacities based off the actual Recipe Inputs. That way a single huge Recipe wont mess up automation of the many smaller ones.
- [FIXED] Some minor Inconsistencies.
- [FIXED] Insanely large Capacity Pipes had Integer Overflow Issues.
- [FIXED] 1 Liter of Fluid sometimes remaining in Pipes.
- [FIXED] Quadruple and Nonuple Pipes had flow direction Issues, because flow direction was per Block and not per Sub-Pipe.
- [FIXED] Miniature Portals for the ExtraSimple fork of ExtraUtilities.
- [FIXED] Durability Loss when Treecapitating using the GT6 Axe, which was using way wrong calculations.
- [CHANGED] Wrenches from Buildcraft and similar Mods can now be crafted again, but if you use them for anything GT related they will instantly break without refunds.
- [CHANGED] Flint and Tinder now has a higher chance of success in certain cases, where there is a specific Material used to craft it.
-
-
- 6.14.03:
- [COMPAT] Some Hardcore Ender Expansion Stuff has Material Data now.
- [FIXED] An Issue with Rendering on some peoples Worlds/Computers.
- [FIXED] Colorless Sapphire Boule Recipe was producing at a wrong rate.
- [CHANGED] Some End Worldgen.
- [ADDED] Magic Research Papers to Library Loot. So far only useful for Thaumcraft. Getting all 9 of them and scanning them with the Thaumometer in order will unlock all Vanilla and GT Aspects. They can be turned into Knowledge Fragments too.
-
-
- 6.14.02:
- [NOTE] The Default Config Pack updated to disable Netherlicious Quartz Generation and some other random things.
- [NOTE] I would recommend updating Netherlicious to 2.2.0 or later, if you have it, by the way.
- [FIXED] An Problem where GT-Fast-Leaf-Decay caused GT6 Trees to lose most of their Leaves when Non-GT6-Logs were harvested closeby.
- [FIXED] An Issue with Trees generating in Snowy Biomes. Only affected the Bottom-most Log of Rubber Trees being misplaced by Snow Layers.
- [FIXED] A lot about the Custom Gearbox was not always working like intended, especially not the internal Axle.
- [FIXED] An Issue where some Machines did not output all Items at once somehow.
- [FIXED] A few Fluid Containers like Et Futurum Glass Bottles (Lingering Potions), Railcraft Creosote Cells and several broken Buckets.
- [FIXED] Charge Speed of GT6 Tools in Battery Boxes.
- [FIXED] Battery Boxes now no longer accept Energy in large bursts. Small bursts may still happen, because I cant set the Energy-Consumption-per-Tick Limiter to a Value lower than what it can actually charge.
- [FIXED] Recipe Replacer did not always know what a vanilla wooden Stick is, since I added a ton of different Wood Materials.
- [FIXED] Sealed Barrels and Drums were still able to be filled or drained through Tap, Funnel and Item-Use.
- [REMOVED] Some of the Tools that did not make proper sense like the Flint Club, Sword and Hoe.
- [CHANGED] The Durability of Bronze Tools got buffed to be more than Wrought Iron, but less than Steel.
- [CHANGED] Many GT6 Wood Tools are now properly craftable. Wooden Clubs are made by putting a Log or Beam on a Stick in a 2x2.
- [CHANGED] Rotating Pillar like Blocks such as Logs or Beams, using a Soft Hammer or Wrench, can now also make them enter their "all sides covered" State. Useful for making custom Trees.
- [CHANGED] The Ceramic Bowl (formerly known as Mixing Bowl) is now made with a Clay Bowl in a Furnace. I also removed the Red Dye requirement. This should fix the Chisel not really being available if you don't have Bronze (even though you likely need to make Bronze to make the Bowl in the first place). Wait was there a Lead Chisel? Well anyways this Recipe makes more sense regardless.
- [CHANGED] The Recipes for Mortars, Juicers, Crucible Stuff, Taps and Funnels are now more similar to the Ceramic Bowl Recipe too. Mortars also only need one Ingot/Gem to craft the Pestle part now.
- [CHANGED] Nozzles and Cap Nozzles made of Ceramic have now been replaced with Steel ones instead.
- [CHANGED] HSLA Steel from Rotarycraft can now no longer be used to make "regular Steel" things (dedicated HSLA things still exist ofcourse), because HSLA is only worth half as much Iron as regular Steel. Yes I found out about the additional Output of that one Reika Blast Furnace Recipe.
- [CHANGED] Stone Bumblebees now ALSO accept Cobblestone, Mossy Cobble and Mossy Bricks, and state so in the Tooltip.
- [CHANGED] Hard and Soft Hammers aswell as Files, can no longer be direct crafted, and now require the typical Toolhead+Handle Recipe to be used. This is to reduce Crafting Recipe Count and because the direct Recipes dont take Handles into account.
- [CHANGED] The Autocollect Effect of Magnetic Materials for Tools also applies for the Handles now. This is only really useful with a Basalz Rod as Tool Handle though, which now counts as Magnetic. Note, that this currently only works with the Toolhead + Rod Recipes, not the hardcoded ones.
- [CHANGED] Blaze Powder can no longer be turned into Sulfur and Ashes using the Centrifuge. However, many Recipes that require Sulfur now also allow Blaze Powder directly. (The Pyrotheum Recipes still require Sulfur seperately!)
- [CHANGED] Blaze Powder and its Thermal Expansion equivalents are now considered a Tiny Pile of Dust instead of a full Pile of Dust. All Recipes should have been adjusted to take this into account.
- [ADDED] Basalz, Blizz and Blitz Powder can now be used for different ways to obtain some Potions in the Distillery.
- [ADDED] Blaze/Blizz/Blitz/Basalz Bumblebees that produce Combs that yield their respective Rods and Dust, this makes it possible to obtain those Mob Drops in Peaceful (or in general since those TE Mobs are way too rare, and yes I know Blaze is already doable with regular Nether Bumbles). Spoiler alert do not continue reading if you wanna find out the combo yourself, it is the combination of the highest Tiers of YRATILIM&YTSORFXDNEXREHTENXDENOTS (you have to read those in reverse, and replace the X-es with Slashes).
- [ADDED] Slimeballs made with Borax and Glue. Borax now also generates as small Ores and is byproduct of regular Salt (NaCl).
- [ADDED] Certain Materials prevent Items from burning in Lava/Fire. Netherite, Blaze, Fiery Steel and Efrine being an example of Materials like that. It is enough to have even the tiniest Amount of such a Material in the Item to prevent it from burning in Lava. You could for example slap a Refactory Wax Cover on a GT6 Block and its fully Lava Proof whenever you drop it.
- [ADDED] Basalt and Blackstone Generator Module since those two Rock Types are just as infinite as Stone.
- [ADDED] Wooden Bucket Recipe with Gold Plate, to make it easier to get from the Nuggets in the Nether.
- [ADDED] Soulsandstone and Red Sandstone can be used in the Grindstone now.
- [ADDED] Efrine Drums, Cells, Pipes, Wires, Anvils and the typical Shelf Stuff. Also Netherite Wires at Aluminium Tier.
- [ADDED] All Wires for 1x to 16x exist now, and not only 5 of the bundles. Does not include Cables!
- [ADDED] Lumium can now be made in a Mixer with all variants of molten Glowstone. Same goes for Lumium Glass and Hardened Glass from Thermal Expansion.
- [ADDED] Lumium Shelves and Stuff. Now there actually is a proper Glow in the Dark Material available. (remember it can be painted)
- [ADDED] Gloomstone from Netherlicious as a Material, which can do pretty much anything Glowstone can do. Similar to GalaxySpace Glowstone Variants.
- [ADDED] Netherquartz now generates in large flat Layers in the Nether. The old GT5 Veins and the Small Ores for Netherquartz wont generate anymore.
- [ADDED] Sulfide Ore Crystals now generate on the Nether ceiling so that it is now possible to actually live in the Nether with most of GT6s Features.
- [ADDED] Netherite Version of the Mortar, because most usable Mortar Materials, including Iron, are too hard to come by in the Nether.
- [ADDED] Magnalium Rail Set. Same Cart Speed and Explosion Resistance as the Steel Rail Set. Big Upgrade from Aluminium, which is basically garbage Tier.
- [ADDED] Mining Tools which can place Torches, now can plug leaking Liquids like Lava with mostly non-valuable mined Blocks from your Inventory. Just rightclick either next to or into the Liquid Block that is coming at you.
- [ADDED] Axes and Saws can now place Workbenches, when you click on something that isn't Wood or a Plant. Why Workbenches? Because Greg wants to free that one Hotbar Slot he always uses for Workbenches, that's why!
- [ADDED] Nametagged Mobs that die, will drop their Nametags (the Tag will still have the Name on it). Note about named Mobs from certain Mods: If the Mob can still despawn, it will NOT drop a Nametag.
- [ADDED] Replicator Recipes for some Food and other Organic Items, using Biomass + Charged/Neutral Matter (or Liquid IC2 UUM). Mostly for making GT6 and Vanilla things, which might otherwise be unobtainable in some cases. This should likely fix the unobtainable Ultimate Stew from Avaritia.
- [ADDED]
- Metal Scaffolds made of each of the Metal Shelf Set Materials.
- These Scaffolds are NOT intended to be identical to any other Scaffolds you might know! They are NOT supposed to be exactly like IC2, Vanilla or any other Scaffolds!
- Vertical Scaffolds contain a Ladder on the inside, which you can use to climb up through the Scaffolds Platform.
- Sneaking ontop of the Scaffold Platform makes it possible to go down the Ladder, as long as you dont stand on the Ladder part itself.
- Sideways Scaffolds need to be connected to at least one vertical Scaffold on the same Y-Level to stay in place.
- You should use Steel Bars or similar as a Guard Rail, if you use the Scaffolds as a Catwalk.


6.15.05-unofficial:
[FIXED] MESU Casing requires double plastic plates to craft.
[FIXED] Copper and Magic Circuit Plates can be recycled to dupe Plastic since they can now be produced with Phenolic Circuit Plates.


6.15.04-unofficial:
[FIXED] When NetheritePlus and Netherlicous are installed at same time, the game will crash.


6.15.03-unofficial:.
[FIXED] MESU requries quadruple rubber plate which cannot be crafted.


6.15.02-unofficial:
[NOTE] Future GT6U version will have a "-unofficial" at the end.
[NOTE] Because the 6.15.00 update is a major merge with Official branch, please report any bugs (e.g. recipes are gone) to the Issues tracker. Thank you.
[FIXED] Some fusion recipes are gone.
[FIXED] Matter Fabrication recipes for Charged Matter and Neutral Matter are gone.
[FIXED] Recipes for superconducter wires are gone.
[FIXED] Biomass recipes in fermenter are gone.


6.15.01-unofficial:
[NOTE] This is a Hotfix (Minor change).
[FIXED] Empty Laser Emitter requiring Circuit (T2) to craft, which makes it impossible to craft.


6.15.00:
[NOTE] Here I am back, merging Greg's big update :D .
[FIXED]
WarpDrive and Tinker's Gregwork does not recognize GT6U because I changed the main version on 6.14.02.
The version is now reverted, but just be aware of what you are using since GT6 official already updated to 6.14.
[CHANGED]
You can no longer synthesize elements after Iron in the periodic table in the Fusion Mk1 Reactor for now.
I will fix this on next release with major changes on Fusion reactor mechanics.
[MERGED] Official 6.14.00 - 6.14.01
- 6.14.01:
- [IMPORTANT] If you use Factorization, use Asie's Version of it from here https://asie.pl/files/mods/Factorization/ (the one with the highest number, without "-dev" at the end of it). The original is broken and may crash with CoFH-Core.
- [NOTE] Just a nice reminder because a bunch of Potion related Stuff happened this update: Ever since Version 6.05.34, using the Bathing Pot you can bath Food Items in a Potion to give the Food Item that Effect.
- [COMPAT] Twilight Forest
- Way better Ore Generation, and allowing Vanilla Ores again in there. GT5 Style Ore Generation is now completely gone from Twilight Forest. (Remember that Iron Ore is already having all its Recipes overridden by GT6)
- In case the Ores look familiar to you, I grabbed and sometimes modified some Textures from previous GT Versions for this.
- The 16 Vanilla-ish Ores that got added are what I think is the minimum viable amount of Ore Types that a GT6 World requires, if we account for the Byproducts.
- I also added the 8 Rock-Layer-Ores in Blob form to there, getting the total count of new Ores up to 24.
- Those specific 24 Ores are also not TileEntity based so the Ore Magnet and the Miner Tree work on those just fine.
- Some Ores only generate above Y=40, meaning you have to find a Hollow Hill, Hydra Cave, Yeti Cave or the Twilight Highlands for them, and some unimportant ones are also Biome dependent in order for them to not be spammed everywhere.
- Thaumcraft and Ars Magica will have their important Ores generate in the Enchanted Forest Biome when installed, even if their own Worldgen is disabled.
- Netherite Plus will have its Ancient Debris spawn in the Deadrock near the final Twilight Castle, so you don't have to go to the Nether for it.
- Bedrock Ores still exist in the Twilight Forest. I even fixed that the Indicator Flowers and Rocks were not generating all that often, due to the giant Leaf Canopy blocking the Generation-Ray-Trace from the Sky (which now ignores specifically Logs and Leaves).
- Solar Panels in Twilight Forest will perpetually produce 4 EU/t all time, so exactly half of what they make in the Overworld during Daytime.
- [COMPAT] OpenBlocks
- The Drain Cover works like an XP Drain when you stand ontop of it and Sneak. It will also absorb stray XP Orbs in front of it. (1 XP = 20L of Liquid XP)
- The Tap will give you one Level worth of XP when you rightclick it, as long as that much is available. Yes you have to click it 30 times if you wanna go all the way from level 0 to level 30.
- The regular and multiblock Furnace Ovens should have a Liquid XP Output along with the normal Item Outputs. Note that the Liquid XP Output Tank has unlimited Capacity unlike the ones of other Machines, so you do not need to worry about the XP stopping the Furnace from operating. The Tap can be useful to extract XP Orbs on an Oven by the way.
- [COMPAT] MineFactory Reloaded
- The Drain Cover can work like a Sewer for Mob Essence from XP Orbs, but only if OpenBlocks is not installed. You can generify Liquid XP into Mob Essence and vice versa. (1 XP = 66.666L of Mob Essence, yes it is such a crummy number)
- It will also work for Sewage from Adult Mobs, based on the Size of the Mob standing on it. Make sure their center is actually above the Drain, we dont want them to miss the Toilet do we?
- [COMPAT] RotaryCraft
- Tungsten Alloy and its direct Items now have Material Data. I think it got one of the most complicated Results in the Chemical Tooltip so far, closing in on the old Garnet Tooltips. XD
- The Flakes from Ore Processing can now be processed in more Machines than just the Furnace (like the Shredder or Sifter for example). Do note that most of those Recipes will output Dusts instead of Ingots now for somewhat obvious reasons. (I cant really do anything against the "Aluminum Dust" that the Ore Extractor outputs since it isn't Flakes)
- Also added Tungsten Alloy Drums, Anvils, Cells, Fluid Pipes, Storages, Shelves etc.
- [COMPAT] Netherlicious
- Netherlicious officially wont ever add Netherite, so the Netherite Plus Mod is still recommended for Netherite Items such as Armor, or the Twilight Forest Netherrite Ore Compat.
- Foxfire Planks are now in the GT6 Wood Dictionary.
- Crimson and Warped Wood Stuff from Netherite Plus are now overidden by Netherlicious Wood Stuff wherever applicable.
- The Mushroom Logs can now properly be made into their Beam counterparts using GT6 Tools.
- Its Food Stuff has more consistency with GT6 now.
- There is also additional ways to make Potions.
- Spectral Dew is a Type of "Nether Water" that can be used in many Recipes and even Boilers that require regular Water.
- [FIXED] Minor Serverside Lag of GT6 Electric Transformers when any IC2 is installed. This should reduce the occurences of it quite a bit, at least with other GT6 TileEntities adjacent to the GT6 Transformer.
- [FIXED] Unscanned Forestry Bees (and some other things) randomly became not properly stackable, whenever a GT6 thing storing them got unloaded and reloaded. (this wont fix any already done problems to the stackability)
- [FIXED] A very minor Localisation Bug with Prospecting on Servers.
- [FIXED] Some Wood Material Data for Erebus, Chisel and Netherite Plus.
- [FIXED] Double Chests should now work with Pipes, Hoppers and similar.
- [FIXED] The wrong Types of Honey and Milk were outputted by some Recipes.
- [FIXED] Twilight Forests dependance on Naga Scales/Trophies, Lich Scepters/Trophies and Hydra Blood/Trophies to trigger their Progress Achievements. Now you ONLY need the Trophy and not that extra Item. Also you can just rightclick a placed Trophy to get its Achievement too.
- [FIXED] Basic Machines were not outputting all their Fluids into Quadruple/Nonuple Pipes if one of the Fluids got Stuck.
- [FIXED] Radiation from Reactors should now not be as high if you are further away from them.
- [CHANGED] The Distillery no longer requires Blaze Rods. Netherwart is enough of a Gatekeeper for Potion Brewing.
- [CHANGED] In order to make Potions in the Distillery you have to use Distilled Water now. Normal Water wont work anymore.
- [CHANGED] Oil now burns in the Burning Box with the same total Power Value as "Fuel", due to being able to get way more Power with a Distillation Towers other additional Fuels later on. I also noticed Soulsand Oil did not have a burn Value so I added that too. You can also use the Distillery again for making Oil to Fuel and Lube at a loss.
- [CHANGED] Battery Boxes now only charge/discharge once per second instead of once per tick. Internal Capacity of the Boxes themselves has been adjusted for this change of Rate.
- [CHANGED] Certain Twilight Tools now have higher Durability so they aren't as "Single Use and Throw away" anymore as before. Applies to: Ore Magnet, Peacock Fan, Crumble Horn and Giant Pickaxe.
- [CHANGED] Twilight Forests Lamp of Cinders works as infinite Flint and Tinder on GT6 Machines and TNT, but it will not spawn Fire Blocks. Can also be used in the modified vanilla Furnace Recipe without being deleted.
- [CHANGED] Swords, Saws, Axes and similar made of Knightmetal or Fiery Steel can now be used to break Twilight Maze Hedges about 40 times faster too. But be sure to wear something protecting you from the 1.5 Hearts of "Cactus" Damage per broken Hedge. Also the Saw should be optimal for this since it autocollects Drops, or the Sense/Scythe due to the Area of Effect.
- [CHANGED] Bastnasite now has Nikolite/Teslatite/Electrotine as a Byproduct if the corresponding Mod exists. It also has an Ore Drop Factor of x3 now.
- [CHANGED] Bumblebees in Twilight Forest now have the same variety that the Overworld ones have.
- [CHANGED] If you non-sneak rightclick Bedrock Ores you will get the overall Bedrock Drill Recipe List in NEI, making it easier to discover what their use is. (Does not apply to Bedrock Fluid Springs, obviously)
- [CHANGED] If you set yourself on Fire and rightclick a GT6 Machine with your bare hand it will count as Igniting the Machine with a Flint and Tinder or similar.
- [ADDED] Red Clay, which is generating in the Nether now. Look at the big Lava Pools, it always generates at the same height.
- [ADDED] Wood Pellets can be turned into Charcoal in the Coke Oven now, which doubles the Fuel Value.
- [ADDED] All Basic Machines now have a Screwdriver Mode, which allows them to not accept more Items in their Input Slots once there is already a Stack inside. This makes precision inserting of Inputs using "Exact Mode Hoppers" and Item Pipes into a Bank of multiple Machines much easier than what you had to do before with Redstone, Shutters and Progress Sensors.
- [ADDED] Thaumcraft Flowers and Saplings should now generate in certain Biomes in the Twilight Forest.
- [ADDED] Recipe for the Name Tag. Yes that did not exist so far in GT6... I somehow forgot adding that one and thought I already did add it...
- [ADDED] Transformation Powder can now be used to turn Mob Spawners into their Twilight Forest Variant and back. You will need 16 Powder at a time for it to work though. I also added some additional Mappings for Spawners just in case.
- [ADDED] The Cube of Annihilation of Twilight Forest is now craftable using a bunch of different Trophies and Loot Items.
- [ADDED] The 36 Trees from Harvestcraft to the Wood Dictionary. Yes I know they mostly use Vanilla Leaves and Logs. Maple and Cinnamon will have their GT6 Counterpart of Beams and Planks assigned.
- [ADDED] Harvestcraft Crops to the List of things that can randomly spawn in the Farming Room in GT6 Dungeons.
- [ADDED] Amethyst Mortar, because there is Situations where Amethysts/Ender-Amethysts are actually more common than Diamonds, Rubies and Sapphires.
- [ADDED] Wooden Buckets for Soy Milk, Glue and Spectral Dew.
- [ADDED] Bedrock Diamond Ore. About twice as rare as Bedrock Gold Ore. Also Pink Diamond is now a Byproduct of regular Diamond.
-
- 6.14.00:
- [NOTE]
- The Thaumic Fixer Mod by Chocohead is no longer needed nor compatible!
- We have our own Version of it now, which also works with more than just ~3 specific Mods... He really fucked up that one...
- This Version of the hack is also compatible with Reikas Mods, unlike Chocoheads.
- [NOTE]
- Bugs that might have happened to a few things, that I might have overlooked could exist, such as:
- "Recipes for certain wooden Items being uncraftable, because of the general Wood Type overhaul"
- "Some random thing might Crash when updating from 6.13 to 6.14 because the ASM Code is not tested with ALL the Mods" (I am very confident this wont happen though, just not confident enough to not mention it at the very least)
- [COMPAT] CoFH-Core should now much less likely crash SinglePlayer Worlds on Startup with the FMLProxyPacket Race Condition. OvermindDL1 made an ASM® thingy to fix it, so my original brutal way isn't needed anymore.
- [COMPAT] TerraFirmaCraft(Plus) Stuff should work slightly better now. TFC Sticks and Torches are now being accounted for when doing Recipe Outputs.
- [IMPROVED] The Extender Manual now has a few more Lines to explain what Extenders are actually doing. I also added a Tooltip to Two-Faced Energy Converters (such as the Thermoelectric Cooler) to remind people that Universal Extenders do exist and can be used to literally cut Corners, when there is no "Thermal Conductor Wires" or similar available.
- [FIXED] An Issue reading Configs on Apple based File Systems (certain Config Files were deleted). I did not think Apple could do a mix of the Windows way and the Linux way of handling Case Sensitivity in File Names to the point of causing this.
- [FIXED] Fluid Tanks/Pipes with huge Capacities should no longer be limited to Integer.MAX_VALUE anymore.
- [FIXED] Lava Blocks should no longer set NON-flammable things on Fire, just because they are made of Wood. (GT Fireproof Wood for example, Forestry Fireproof Wood is wrongly implemented sadly)
- [FIXED] Some things I saw GT6U has fixed too, like TFC Damage Multipliers for Heat and Frost Damage.
- [FIXED] Whoops, I made Titanium Invisible by accident.
- [FIXED] Crash with IC2 when High Level Radiation Effects are applied, like the ones from Neutronium.
- [FIXED] There was ~5 second long Lag Spikes, when certain Recipes were asked for, by the On-Demand Recipe System. Specifically Recipes with Selector Tags, Extruder Shapes or Fluids (Sawmill), aswell as Recipes with Empty Slots in the Anvil (Item Casings).
- [FIXED] Drones just vanished instead of dieing during the Bumblebee Breeding Process in a Bumbliary. Now there actually is Corpses for the dead breeding Drones too.
- [CHANGED] Certain Worldgen Features will no longer be present in the Overworld when TerraFirmaCraft is loaded.
- [CHANGED] Made Pincers and the Plunger the right Tool to harvest the Dragon Egg and Dragon-Egg-like Mod Blocks. The Vanilla Dragon Egg still teleports though!
- [CHANGED] Technically speaking, Shovels/Spades/Plows and such should be able to break Fire now, BUT due to the nature of how you click Fire to break it, that wont directly work. This is just a special case in case a Mod adds a Block that uses the Material "Fire", so that it can be harvested somehow.
- [CHANGED] Crates now use Crowbar Harvesting to drop their Contents instead of Rightclicking with Crowbar. Also works with the Universal Spade.
- [CHANGED] Crates can now be made with Wooden and Plastic Screws too. Iron based Screws were maybe a little bit of a too difficult requirement for this kind of thing.
- [CHANGED] Pipe/Wire Selection Boxes and placement Behavior for the better.
- [ADDED] Zeolite to Dungeon Loot Chests just to make sure people can find it by accident.
- [ADDED] Pickaxes and Drills made of Knightmetal or Fiery Steel can now be used to break Twilight Maze Walls about 40 times faster. The Construction Pickaxe is faster than the regular Pickaxe in this case, since the Maze Bricks dont count as natural.
- [ADDED] Tapes can now be put in Shelves. Remote Activators can also be put in Shelves now, but are hidden as a Book like most things you might not want people to notice, such as Levers or Keys.
- [ADDED] The Shelf in Workshops in GT6 Dungeons now contains two Rolls of Tape, which is always enough to haul both of the Stone Mass Storages and then some.
- [ADDED] Farming themed Room to GT6 Dungeons to showcase the Universal Flower Pot and a good use for Glowtus as Covering for the Water Hole in Farms.
- [ADDED]
- The Coconut Tree from GT6U got Backported, and has been given proper development. No longer a tall Hazel Tree Ripoff.
- These Trees will grow at Beach Biomes, aswell as most Tropical and Oasis Biomes.
- Due to the lower amount of Leaves, they have a higher Sapling rate than any other GT6 Tree to compensate.
- You might have found those "Work in Progress" Saplings in random Chests in Dungeons and such, now they are all growable.
- The dropped Coconuts behave just like other Mods Coconuts in GT6 Recipes, and if you didn't have such Mods, you can make Coconut Milk, Coconut Cream and similar now.
- [ADDED]
- Dedicated Wood Materials for many Types of Wood.
- This will influence basically every common Wood ITEM. Ofcourse the Generifier works on all of them.
- Sticks generated on the ground in the World can have different Materials like Rotten, Mossy or Dead Wood aswell as Biome specific Variants (Birch Forest Biome = Birch Sticks). They can be used like normal Sticks.
- The NEI Tree Family GUI also got 6 more Slots now to display which amounts of Sticks/Pulp/Bark/Charcoal you can get from each Type of Tree.
- Many Crates that contain Wood Planks now have this variety too. Some of these Crates can also be found in GT6 Dungeons in a new Pile that isn't the Metal Crates.
- Forestry Stuff can now be Fire Proofed like the GT6 and Vanilla Logs/Beams/Planks. (Forgot to add those Recipes to my Stuff initially)


6.14.07:
[NOTE] I am busy during this end of 2020 and will not be able to update GT6u again until around 2021 February.
You can still report any bug or suggestion you found in GT6u. See you then.
[FIXED] Fuel Cleaner now auto-searches for any kind of sulfured fuel that are in the fluid slots of it. And it will automatically change to execute that fuel cleaning recipe.
[COMPAT] Compatibility with TFC & TFC-Plus food system. GT Foods can now be consumed when Terra Firma Craft is installed and they have the five tastes (sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and savory) in TFC now.

6.14.06:
[FIXED] MESU cannot save energy correctly.
[FIXED] Perforated Bushing having wrong material information.
[CHANGED] Increased the yield of Epoxid Resin and Photoresist production.
[CHANGED] Degraded IV Batteries capacity and their recipes are now like before.
[CHANGED] NEI recipes no longer display that misleading "Tier".
[ADDED] Multiblock Energy Storage Unit (MESU).
Its dimensions can be changed in a range, providing different voltages and energy capacity. Longer it is, higher voltage it has. Larger it is, greater capacity it has.
Use a screwdriver to alter its current output, up to 32 Amps.
[ADDED] Lithium-F-Phosphate, a salt used in Li-ion battery electrolyte, Ethyl Methyl Carbonate.
[ADDED] Six battery cores for MESU. Each has different capacity.
[ADDED] Two battery electrode parts for MESU. Each allows different length-voltage multiplier of the battery.


6.14.05:
Broken, do not use!


6.14.04:
[NOTE] This is not a really important update, just for the hotfix. I will not merge GT6 until the Asmization is tested with some time.
[FIXED] MacOs File System causes some config files to reset during launch.


6.14.03:
[COMPAT] When TerraFirmaCraft or TerraFirmaCraft Plus is loaded, the heat, electric, and chemical damage is accommodated.
[FIXED] Titanium not showing up in NEI.
[FIXED] Biochemical Research Lab cannot form in some direction of facing.
[FIXED] Fermenting recipe conflicts.
[CHANGED] Less time is now required to incubate the biomass-origin bacterias.


6.14.02:
[NOTE] This is a quite major update, read the changelog before update is recommended...
[MERGED] Merged official branch 6.13.02
- 6.13.02:
- [COMPAT] HBM Nuclear Tech has some more Compatiblity Data attached to it. Mainly Shelf Data. The Alloys it has are a little bit too weird.
- [COMPAT] HEXCrafts Hexorium Ore is generated in all possible ways when installed, with RGB ones closer to Surface and Black and White ones closer to Bedrock. Also some Hexorium related Recipes added. Its Energized Monoliths can also be found as Decoration in GT Dungeons.
- [FIXED] A weird Interaction with Robot Arms and Extenders that resulted in Extenders sometimes choosing the secondary Facing as destination for Items, even though the Items did not come from the promary Facing, including targetting things like GT6 Red Alloy Wires that dont even have Slots to put shit into, resulting in a Crash of the Block that has the Robot Arm.
- [FIXED] Tooltips for Mob Spawn Proofing will now show it whenever Optifine breaks the mechanic in Singleplayer, because clearly removing Metadata support from World functions is a good Idea and "totally fixable" on my end...
- [FIXED] GT6 Redstone Wiring sometimes checked multiple/infinite times per tick for Vanilla signals. This was leading to Game Freezes with Thermal Expansion.
- [FIXED] Some Biomes from Enhanced Biomes were not counted as River for my Worldgen.
- [FIXED] Skeletons were not shooting the right GT Arrows since a long time. Now I made an actual List of Arrows to shoot, instead of grabbing any of the existing Arrows. This also means no Radiation Arrow shooting Skeletons anymore.
- [FIXED] Made Config Files always migrate to Lowercase File Names so random Garbage with Windows and older Config Files wont happen again.
- [CHANGED] The Capsule and Cell Extruder Recipes were not really well coded, so I fixed them up. Should make it easier to work with for the GT6U Team too.
- [CHANGED] Moderated Reactor Rods now lose durability twice as fast compared to what it was before.
- [CHANGED] Molten Midasium is now able to turn Lead into Gold at a ratio of 1 Midasium + 4 Lead = 4 Gold. This is better than using a Generifier on Midasium to directly make it into Gold 1:1.
- [ADDED] There is now small Rocks in the Nether, some of which contain tiny amounts of Ancient Debris, and are as rare as Meteorites on the Surface. Glowstone, NetherQuartz and Flint can be found in them too.
- [ADDED] Config to disable the nutrition System for Sugar, Fat and Dehydration. Alcohol and Caffeine stay though, since those are definitely things people intentionally consume for buffs and such.
- [ADDED] Netherite Drum, Fluid Pipes/Capsules and Anvil. Netherite also counts as Acid Proof now, due to its high Gold content. Also added Gold Fluid Pipes/Capsules while I was at it.
- [ADDED] Laser-O-Meter Sensor for Laser Fiber Wires.
[FIXED] Recipe for Titanium Niobium Carbide Dynamo Mainblock.
[FIXED] Recipe for Titanium Niobium Carbide Turbine Mainblock.
[FIXED] Recipes for Large Mass Fab and Mass Replicator Mainblocks are the same.
[FIXED] When centrifuging energy crystal dust you can get more sapphire dust.
[FIXED] A log error of NetheritePlus recipe when NePl is not loaded.
[CHANGED] The Mod name is now 'GregTech 6 Unofficial' to avoid ambiguity.
[CHANGED] Thanks to Greg notifying me that dust not being able to put into Extruders will cause plastic and similar materials unable to be processed into capsules, etc. I reverted the change so Extruders can process them now again.
[CHANGED] Fusion Reactor Mk1 now requires LU for start energy and EU for the maintaining energy. Since a Tokamak design is used here, electricity should be used to maintain the current in the coils.
[CHANGED] PVC production yield now decrease.
[CHANGED] There is now a config option to choose whether Long distance pipes can be crafted with less material.
[CHANGED] Renamed Oil Cleaner into Fuel Cleaner.
[CHANGED] Lowered the cost of Fuel Cleaner and Clean stainless steel machine casing.

6.14.01:
[NOTE] Do not use 6.14.00, it will crash the game.
[MERGED]Merged official branch 6.13.01
- 6.13.01:
- [FIXED] a Bug that crashes every single Crafting Recipe, sorry about that lol.
- [FIXED] Some Localisation Issues with Reika's Fluids, it should be fine now. It will work with all other Unlocalized Fluids too, so GT6 will display the most proper Fluid Name that it can display now.
- 6.13.00
- [NOTE] Sorry for letting this one take so long.
- [NOTE] I got a report that Riverwater, Swampwater and Oceanwater cannot be scanned with the Thaumometer, I can not replicate that Issue though, so I guess it is either fixed or something is wrong with their Modpack.
- [COMPAT] Netherite Plus got Compatibility now. It backports Netherite to 1.7.10. Soulfire Torch Placement by Tools, Record Shelving, Blackstone, Biomass, and the two Wood Types should all work in GregTech Stuff, also Netherite Ingots are made the Crucible way now instead of Crafting Debris with Gold Ingots. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/netheriteplus
- [FIXED] Seems like QwertTech might have messed up the Recipes for putting Planks in a Bathing Pot to get Treated Wood. This Issue might be fixed now for Vanilla Planks.
- [FIXED] The GT6 Axe was still slowed down on my end, when TreeCapitator was actually installed, resulting in a Double Slowdown.
- [FIXED] Heat Exchangers and Diesel Motors were wasting Fuel in certain Situations. Typically when they were operated while constantly out of Fuel.
- [FIXED] Failing to Load Save Files in Singleplayer when you already loaded another World before.
- [FIXED] Pam's Harvestcraft Fishtrap Bait Recipe for Mixing Bowl had a lower amount of Output than intended.
- [FIXED] Thaumcraft Golems were not chopping GT6 Logs, because it checks for the wrong OreDict String, and because it checks for Block IDs using Block Objects which is kinda screwed up, so I had to fix that too.
- [FIXED] 7 Bits are definitely not enough to store Numbers that can go up to 12 Billion. Fusion Reactor Start Energy is now properly saved when unloaded.
- [FIXED] Terrafirmacraft Plus not being detected as Terrafirmacraft.
- [FIXED] Clay Ore that comes from Hematite Bedrock Drilling is now processable.
- [FIXED] Some Ars Magica Unification things.
- [FIXED] The way I overrode the Railcraft Plate Names was kinda jank so I made it use the GregTech Language File now.
- [FIXED] JABBA Dollys can no longer pick up GT6 Shelves. Somehow they were still able to be picked up even though I prevented them from working on GT Blocks as a whole, ages ago.
- [FIXED] Infinite Items Glitch caused by InvTweaks making 111 Stacks and NEI keeping those at an Infinite Level, causing Infinite Item Duplication, if a Stack with higher than its custom Maximum Size enters a GT6 GUI Slot, while the GUI is being kept open. Now if that happens I will just cap the Stacksize at 64, potentially deleting Items, but that is what you get for InvTweaks being screwed up.
- [CHANGED] When Machines can process multiple Items in a row in one go, they wont process more than a Minutes worth of Stuff at a time, assuming maximum Power Input. This applies to things like the Crusher, Sifter, Compressor, Squeezer, Electrolyzer and Centrifuge for example.
- [CHANGED] Bath Recipes that have an Output Stacksize of more than 1 now have their Outputs spread over the 6 Output Slots. This should make it easier to parallel process Ores in a Multiblock Bath. (I may or may not have slightly buffed the Outputs of some Ore Recipes too)
- [CHANGED] Blastproofness Tooltip now also mentions Strong Dynamite Proofness and doesn't stop at TNT-Proof anymore.
- [CHANGED] NEI Fuel Lists are now no longer listing the confusing and irrelevant EU/t Value.
- [CHANGED] More Reactor Test Stuffs from Erik3003.
- [CHANGED] Crucibles now glow when they are within 100 Kelvin of melting down.
- [ADDED] Netherite things, such as Crucibles, Burning Boxes and all the Shelf Stuff. The Crucible Tier is same as Meteoric Steel. The good Netherite Tools are made by bathing Diamond in molten Netherite. The bad Netherite Tools are, well, not that good. Ancient Debris does generate in the Nether now as rare small Ore.
- [ADDED] Infinite Bedrock Veins for Ancient Debris in the Nether. Relatively high Probability compared to all other Bedrock Veins. Will also exist without Netherrite Plus.
- [ADDED] Ancient Debris aka "Netherite Scraps" can now be used in the Massfabricator to make liquid Enderpearl. Which then can be used in a Replicator to make it into an actual Enderpearl. Dont ask me what sense it makes, the Massfabricator does it, not me.
- [ADDED] The HV Lightning Processor can be used to turn Blocks of Solid Netherite combined with a few other Ingredients into Netherstars.
- [ADDED] Uranium Hexaflouride Processing Chain by Erik3003. And fixed by Greg, because the Maths of the Recipes were "Perfectly Balanced without Exploits", except for the obvious dupes of every single Recipe added.
- [ADDED] Ownership Reset Config for people who locked themselves out of Stuff like Mechanical Safes in SinglePlayer.
- [ADDED] Small Cinnabar Ore to the Nether.
- [ADDED] Ars Magica Chimerite Ore when it is installed.
- [ADDED] Steam can now be put in Chem Tubes.
- [ADDED]

- 6.12.02:
- [NOTE] This one automatically triggers the outdated Major Version Notification to nonupdated Users (once it is released), because ofcourse the first one or two of a Major Version tend to be buggy.
- [FIXED] TerraFirmaCraft Attack Damage Multiplier for GT6 Tools to be 80 instead of 10 and actually showing in the Tooltip.
- [FIXED] Thaumcraft Aspects for Nuggets and Ingots now check if they are supposed to be Metallum, and if not, then they will replace it with Ordo.
- [FIXED] Reactors blew up when no Coolant was in them while a minimal amount of Power was left over and they did not have any Rods.
- [FIXED] IC2-Classic Watermills should now accept Ocean and River Water. This requires a pending update on the IC2-Classic Side aswell.
- [FIXED] GT6 Tools should now work with Treecapitator installed as long as Treecapitator detects them as valid Tools.
- [FIXED] A Rare NEI Recipe List Crash. (Concurrent Modification Exception when clicking Progress Bar)
- [FIXED] Bedrock Ores did not generate Indicator Flowers and Indicator Rocks in Twilight Forest due to its Terrains normal Height of Y31 instead of Y63.
- [FIXED] The Code that made Plates, Ingots and Rocks placeable did not check if the Stack was already a Block, meaning it just replaced things like Greatwood Planks or Silverwood Planks with the Stack-of-Plates Block.
- [FIXED] Gearboxes sometimes breaking/overloading on World Load.
- [FIXED] Some Issue with Coke Ovens and other Ignition based Basic Machines, hopefully.
- [FIXED] Bumbliaries were lacking Tooltips.
- [FIXED] Reactor Rods in general were not ON/OFF sensitive.
- [FIXED] The Running-Possible Sensors now also return Redstone when the Output happens to be blocked at that moment.
- [FIXED] Made Tooltips for Power Input/Output of Machines now have a special verbiage for a Minimum of "1 Unit per Tick" or less, by saying "up to MAX per Tick" instead.
- [CHANGED] Coke Ovens now have 9 Output Slots due to the Recipe that outputs 5/6 Chunks of Coal Coke, so that each Coke Chunk gets 1 Slot.
- [ADDED] Chili Crop which was missing.
- [ADDED] Snow Golems can have their poop picked up by GT6 Hoppers automatically without constantly breaking a Snow Layer Block. Also works with Et Futurums silent replacement for Snow Golems, yes I luckily noticed that...
- [ADDED] Reactors can use Distilled Water as Coolant, but that uses a different System so beware. Also it is not tested or finished yet! Also Reactor Explosions are disabled yet again until.
- [ADDED] Geiger Counter Sensor courtesy of Erik3003.
- 6.12.01:
- [FIXED] A doubled up Magnifying Glass Tooltip on the Large Heat Exchanger.
- [FIXED] Large Heat Exchanger did not let Pipes connect to its Output.
- [FIXED] The ON/OFF State of a Reactor while setting it up is more consistent now. Also Soft Hammers can turn it ON/OFF too now.
- [FIXED] Crucible Crossings were rather directional when chained together.
- [CHANGED] Purified and Refined Coal Ore in the Coke Oven will give 5 Chunks of Coke instead of 1 Gem.
[FIXED] Localized name for Circuit Assembler should not be "Circult Assembler".
[FIXED] Chromium production chain is not balanced correctly on GT manner, again. Not it is fixed.
